    "Object-Oriented Programming Language: An OOPL (object-oriented programming language) is a programming language that is base\n",
    "on the object-oriented programming model explained above. Examples of object-oriented programming languages are C++, C#, \n",
    "Java, Python, Simula, and Smalltalk. When programming in an object-oriented programming language, you should keep the \n",
    "following four key concepts in mind. Encapsulation - The grouping of related functions and data (variables) together into an\n",
    "object to help reduce complexity and allow parts of the code to be reused. Abstraction - Show only the essentials to reduce \n",
    "the abstract of change. Inheritance - Eliminate redundant code by inheriting functions and data from other classes. \n",

    "Question 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Re-usability It means reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. This is done with the use of a \n",
    "class. We can use it ‘n’ number of times as per our need.\n",
    "  Data Redundancy This is a condition created at the place of data storage (you can say Databases)where the same piece of \n",
    "data is held in two separate places. So the data redundancy is one of the greatest advantages of OOP. If a user wants a \n",
    "similar functionality in multiple classes he/she can go ahead by writing common class definitions for the similar \n",
    "functionalities and inherit them.\n",
    "  Code Maintenance This feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in \n",
    "many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into \n",
    "it.\n",
    "  Security With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to exposure which means \n",
    "we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Design Benefits If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and fixing \n",
    "things easily and eliminating the risks (if any). Here the Object Oriented Programs forces the designers to have a longer \n",
    "and extensive design phase, which results in better designs and fewer flaws. After a time when the program has reached some \n",
    "critical limits, it is easier to program all the non-OOP’s one separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Better productivity with the above-mentioned facts of using the application definitely enhances its users overall \n",
    "productivity. This leads to more work done, finish a better program, having more inbuilt features and easier to read, write \n",
    "and maintain. An OOP programmer cans stitch new software objects to make completely new programs. A good number of libraries \n",
    "with useful functions in abundance make it possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Easy troubleshooting lets witness some common issues or problems any developers face in their work. Is this the problem in \n",
    "the widget file? Is the problem is in the WhaleFlumper? Will I have to trudge through that ‘sewage.c’ file? Commenting on \n",
    "all these issues related to code. So, many a time it happens that something has gone wrong which later becomes so \n",
    "brainstorming for the developers to look where the error is. Relax! Working with OOP language you will know where to look \n",
    "for. This is the advantage of using encapsulation in OOP; all the objects are self-constrained. With this modality behavior, \n",
    "the IT teams get a lot of work benefits as they are now capable to work on multiple projects simultaneously with an advantage\n",
    "that there is no possibility of code duplicity.\n",
    "  Polymorphism Flexibility Let’s see a scenario to better explain this behavior.You behave in a different way if the place \n",
    "or surrounding gets change. A person will behave like a customer if he is in a market, the same person will behave like a \n",
    "student if he is in a school and as a son/daughter if put in a house. Here we can see that the same person showing different \n",
    "behavior every time the surroundings are changed. This means polymorphism is flexibility and helps developers in a number of \n",
    "ways. • It’s simplicity • Extensibility\n",
    "  Problems solving Decomposing a complex problem into smaller chunks or discrete components is a good practice. OOP is \n",
    "specialized in this behavior, as it breaks down your software code into bite-sized – one object at a time. In doing this the \n",
    "broken components can be reused in solutions to different other problems (both less and more complex) or either they can be \n",
    "replaced by the future modules which relate to the same interface with implementations details.\n"
